# Example: Flutter Animated Toast

This is a simple example demonstrating how to use the `flutter_animated_toast` package to show animated toast messages in a Flutter app.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have the package added in your `pubspec.yaml` (if testing locally, use a path dependency):

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_animated_toast:
    path: ../   # points to the package directory
